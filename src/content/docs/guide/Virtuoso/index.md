Virtuoso is a high-performance object-relational SQL database that supports transactions, a smart SQL compiler, a powerful stored-procedure language, optional Java and .Net server-side hosting, hot backup, and SQL-99. It integrates major data-access interfaces like ODBC, JDBC, ADO .Net, and OLE/DB.

It includes a built-in web server for dynamic web pages and supports VSP, PHP, ASP .Net, SOAP, and REST for stored procedures. Virtuoso also features a WebDAV repository for hosting web content with versioning and metadata extraction, compatible with WebDAV clients in Windows XP and Mac OSX.

Virtuoso supports SPARQL embedded into SQL for querying RDF data, with type-casting rules and a dedicated IRI data type, enhancing its RDF data querying capabilities.
