## Brief Introduction to Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge graphs are structured representations of knowledge, enabling the linking of information across diverse sources and providing a semantic context for data. They are essential for various applications, including search engines, recommendation systems, and data integration.

## Importance and Applications of Knowledge Graphs
Knowledge graphs enhance data interoperability, facilitate advanced analytics, and support intelligent applications like virtual assistants and predictive modeling. They are used in industries such as healthcare, finance, and e-commerce.

## Interoperability of Knowledge Graphs
Interoperability is crucial in the context of Knowledge graphs because it enables seamless data integration, exchange, and reuse across different systems, domains, and organizations. By adhering to established standards, such as those for representation (RDF, Labelled Property Graphs, etc.), or querying (SPARQL, Graph Query Language, etc.), interoperable KGs ensure that diverse datasets can be linked and understood in a unified way, reducing data silos, and enhancing discoverability. In the following report, we provide an overview and best practices on such standards and practices by focusing on metadata mapping, linking, and integration:

## Overview of the Software Solutions
**Virtuoso**: A cross-platform universal server that integrates web, file, and database server functionalities with native XML storage and universal data access middleware.

**Apache Jena**: A Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications, offering tools for data handling, ontology management, and SPARQL querying.

**QLever**: A high-performance query engine tailored for SPARQL, optimized to handle large RDF datasets efficiently. It integrates full-text search capabilities, making it particularly suitable for semantic search tasks and knowledge graph exploration.

**Wikibase**: Wikibase is the open source software environment built to run Wikidata. It allows the storage and management of Linked Open Data (LOD), besides featuring other common characteristics of wikis, such as collaboration and version control features.

## Purpose and Scope of the Guidelines
These guidelines provide step-by-step instructions, educational videos, and best practices for creating and hosting knowledge graphs using Virtuoso and Apache Jena. They are intended to assist users in setting up, configuring, and utilizing these software solutions effectively.
