# What is Apache Jena?

Apache Jena is a free and open-source Java framework for building Semantic Web and Linked Data applications. It provides tools and libraries for working with RDF (Resource Description Framework), SPARQL (a query language for RDF), and OWL (Web Ontology Language), making it useful for creating and managing knowledge graphs, ontologies, and data integration systems.

## Why Do I Need Apache Jena?

Apache Jena is essential for developers and organizations looking to manage complex data relationships, ensure interoperability between data sources, and leverage Linked Data. It helps enrich data by linking it to external resources, and it offers scalability for handling large RDF datasets.
