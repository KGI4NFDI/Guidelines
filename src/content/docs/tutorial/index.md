## **Welcome to the Tutorials Section**

This section contains **step-by-step guides** to help you work with **Knowledge Graphs (KGs)**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and various **tools** like **Virtuoso, Apache Jena, and LlamaIndex**.

Unlike the **Guidelines** section, which provides general best practices and configurations, the **Tutorials** focus on **hands-on implementation** with **code examples, setup instructions, and real-world applications**.

---

## **What Youâ€™ll Find Here**

- **Practical Use Cases:** Learn how to integrate LLMs with Knowledge Graphs.
- **Code Samples:** Copy, modify, and run working code for various applications.
- **Step-by-Step Instructions:** Detailed setup guides for different tools.
- **Troubleshooting Tips:** Common issues and solutions for smoother implementation.

## **Available Tutorials**

- **[Querying Knowledge Graphs with LLMs](./kg_llms)**  
  Learn how to use an LLM (Llama or OpenAI) to query a Virtuoso knowledge graph with natural language.

- **[Extracting Knowledge Graph Triples from Text](./extracting-triples-with-llms)**  
  Discover how to extract structured **(subject, predicate, object)** triples from unstructured text using an LLM.

- **[More Tutorials Coming Soon](#)**
